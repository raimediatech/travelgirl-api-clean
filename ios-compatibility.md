# iOS Compatibility Fixes

This document outlines the changes made to improve compatibility with iOS devices, particularly for iOS 15.

## Issues Addressed

- Dropdown items not showing for country and city lists on iOS devices
- CORS-related issues specific to iOS WebView components
- Response format compatibility issues

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced CORS Configuration (index.js)

- Added comprehensive CORS settings with explicit headers
- Added preflight request handling with `app.options('*', cors())`
- Set appropriate cache control headers

### 2. Country List API Improvements (getCountries function)

- Added device-type detection to provide different handling for iOS
- For iOS devices:
  - Added explicit CORS headers to each response
  - Used `.lean()` to ensure plain JavaScript objects are returned
  - Added no-cache headers to prevent stale data
  - Set explicit Content-Type header

### 3. City List API Improvements (getCities function)

- Added device-type detection to provide different handling for iOS
- For iOS devices:
  - Used simpler query approach instead of aggregation pipeline
  - Added explicit CORS headers to each response
  - Added no-cache headers to prevent stale data
  - Improved error handling with detailed logging

## Testing

These changes have been tested on:
- iOS 15
- Android (existing functionality preserved)

## Deployment Notes

When deploying to Render.com:
1. Make sure all files are committed to the repository
2. Deploy using the "Clear build cache & deploy" option
3. Check logs for any potential issues during deployment# iOS Compatibility Fixes
